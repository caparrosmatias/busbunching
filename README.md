# Bus Bunching Simulator :bus:
## Bus Bunching effect Simulator in Javascript

**Attention: this project is not finished at all, some details remain to be finalized.**

In public transport, bus bunching refers to a group of two or more transit vehicles (such as buses or trains), running along the same route, which were scheduled to be evenly spaced, but instead run in the same place at the same time. This occurs when at least one of the vehicles is unable to keep to its schedule and therefore ends up in the same location as one or more other vehicles which are supposed to be behind it.

The result is unreliable service and longer and more inconsistent effective wait times than scheduled. Another unfortunate result can be overcrowded vehicles followed closely by near-empty ones.

### Code:

The purpose of this project is to simulate this effect. The code was created from scratch by Matias Caparros. Based on d3.js.

### Use:

By clicking on "Start All" button the "buses" will start their journey. 

With the "delay controls" you can add or decrease the time of the routes 1, 2, 3 or 4 (simulating with this a delay or a traffic jam).

### Things to add:

- Prevent one bus from passing to the other.
- Simulate the speed of each bus.
- Draw the route with curves.
